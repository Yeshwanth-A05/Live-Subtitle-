English–Tamil Neural Machine Translation



A deep learning–based English–Tamil NMT system comparing Seq2Seq with Attention and Transformer architectures for low-resource translation.

📌 Overview

Improves translation quality using attention mechanisms, subword tokenization, and Transformer-based models. Performance evaluated using BLEU and chrF metrics.

🧠 Models

Seq2Seq (Encoder–Decoder)

Attention Mechanism

Transformer (Self-Attention)

Subword Tokenization

Word Embeddings

⚙️ Workflow

Data → Preprocessing → Tokenization → Training → Evaluation → Inference
