English–Tamil Neural Machine Translation








A deep learning–based English–Tamil Neural Machine Translation (NMT) system comparing Seq2Seq with Attention and Transformer architectures for low-resource language translation.

📌 Overview

This project aims to improve translation quality between English and Tamil by leveraging modern deep learning architectures and subword tokenization techniques. The system evaluates performance using BLEU and chrF metrics.
